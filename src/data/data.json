    "About": {
        "paragraph": "According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, 15% of American adults (37.5 million) report some trouble hearing, yet only 1 in 5 people that would benefit from a hearing aid use one. Sound Sustainabilityâ€™s online hearing screening removes barriers preventing people from determining whether they have hearing loss. To do this, we worked with audiologists to produce a free, easy-to-use, hearing screening that has users listen and respond to a series of tones played at different frequencies and decibels. Our goal is to allow people concerned for their hearing health to quickly check their hearing within the comfort of their own homes.",
        "Why": [
            "Ability to screen from the comfort of your own home",
            "No need to provide any personal identifying information",
            "Completely free screening at no cost to user",
            "Simple design that clearly lays out screening process",
            "User may create account to save results to track over time"
